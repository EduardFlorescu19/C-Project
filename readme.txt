This project is developed in C# and focuses on building an application with a robust model and user interface components. The project requirements are as follows:
Class Definition

The project requires the implementation of classes that fulfill the following criteria:

    At least 2 classes derived from the interfaces IClonable and IComparable.
    The classes must have constructors and properties for their private attributes.
    Overloading of operators, including at least 2 out of <, >, +, -, ++, --, cast, etc.
    One of the classes must include a unidimensional or bidimensional array, with support for indexers and optionally foreach.
    If one of the classes represents a collection, the foreach loop should be implemented.
    Implementation of at least 2 data processing methods within the classes.
    Definition of at least one interface or abstract class.

Interface Development
    Data validation; saving/restoring data to/from a file. If working with databases, only writing to text files is accepted.
    Development of a main and context-specific menus interface.
    Graphical presentation of basic or calculated data.
    Printing a document.
    Mandatory - Storing and retrieving data from a database.
    Using an XML file.
